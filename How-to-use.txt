SpeechForm for problem statement - Fill application form without typing

This app is basically to fill a form by our speech or voice I should say. This app can fill any form present in a website.
Just copy Url of the website in which there a form to be filled and paste it in this app's url box and tap  "Go".
As soon as the page loads, we will see a popup where we see inputs fields of type "text","email" , "password"and textareas
which are the most common used types, with its label (if there is) and hint of it(placeholder) eg for input like:

Your User : Enter your username  -- It shows : Your user : (hint) Enter your username

Just to show which input is in take.

It shows all inputs in a page, thats why in case if the website is not showing all inputs, it looks like its showing extra
inputs but thats not the case, its just shows all inputs of that types above.

In the popup tap "start" and its start asking to speak for the input, listen and speak for that respective input field
and it will fill that input.

We have autofill option to. It detects which inputs contain your autofill keys in Autofill data page, and shows to
you in Autofill popup.
